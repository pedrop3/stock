## 🚀 Features

### 🔄 Stock Movement
- Handles product inflows and outflows.
- Keeps a detailed and auditable movement history.

### 📊 Minimum and Maximum Stock Management
- Defines minimum and maximum stock levels per product.
- Sends alerts when stock reaches critical thresholds.

### 🔁 Turnover Analysis
- Analyzes product sales frequency.
- Helps categorize high-turnover and low-turnover items.

### 📈 ABC Curve Classification
- Classifies products into:
  - A: Most valuable
  - B: Intermediate
  - C: Low-value
- Enhances decision-making and focus on Class A items.

### 🛑 Obsolete Product Management
- Identifies and handles slow-moving or outdated products.

## 🧠 Architecture & Design

- 📐 **Clean Layered Architecture**: Separation of concerns between controller, service, repository, and domain.
- 🔌 **Strategy Pattern**: Used to process different types of stock movements (IN, OUT).
- 🔍 **OpenAPI (Swagger)**: Auto-generated API documentation for testing and integration.
- ✅ **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for services and strategies.
  - Integration tests for controller and exception handling.
